## Opening the project

This project has [Dev Container support](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers), so it will be be setup automatically if you open it in Github Codespaces or in local VS Code with the [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers).

If you're not using one of those options for opening the project, then you'll need to:

1. Create a [Python virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html#creating-virtual-environments) and activate it.

1. Install production requirements:

    ```sh
    python -m pip install -r demo_code/requirements.txt
    ```


1. Apply database migrations and seed initial data:

    ```sh
    python demo_code/manage.py migrate
    python demo_code/manage.py loaddata demo_code/seed_data.json
    ```

## Running locally

Run gunicorn on the app:

```sh
python3 manage.py collectstatic
python3 -m gunicorn project.wsgi:application --name relecloud
```

## Running tests

2. Install the development requirements:

    ```sh
    python3 -m pip install -r requirements-dev.in
    playwright install --with-deps
    ```

3. Run the tests:

    ```sh
    python3 -m pytest
    ```
